# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Resources
Read or watch:

- [Sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
- [Big O notation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation)

- [15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg) (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
